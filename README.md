## üéØ About

This project consists of a web application built with HTML(PUG), CSS (Sass), and JavaScript. The main goal is to provide a responsive user interface with dynamic features like a language switcher, year display, and collapsible menu.

## ‚ú® Features

**Responsive Layout:**
The design adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Language Switcher:**
The language switcher allows the user to toggle between different languages. The default language is set to English, and it can be dynamically changed by clicking the language options in the dropdown. 3. Year Display
The current year is displayed in the footer, automatically updating each year. This is done using JavaScript to dynamically set the year in the HTML element with the class .cur-year.

**Year Display:**
The current year is displayed in the footer, automatically updating each year. This is done using JavaScript to dynamically set the year in the HTML element with the class .cur-year.

**Collapsible Navbar:**
The navbar collapses on smaller screen sizes, with a hamburger icon appearing to toggle the visibility of the navigation links.

**Custom Styles with SCSS:**
The styles are written in SCSS for better maintainability and structure.
